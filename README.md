# This repo is a component redesign for A Race athlete web app and blog using material-ui@next (v1 beta).

Besides moving to a new version of material-ui, some of the other styling things are changing as well.

In no particular order:

* New Theme, still darker than MUI but more consistent with the idea.
* Smaller components with the logic coming from containers
* Consolidating icons to the mdi-react set.
* Styleguidist as a style guide

I'll continue to work on component parity with production ARA and expect to move them over as soon as material-ui goes GA.
